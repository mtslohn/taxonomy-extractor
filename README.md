# taxonomy-extractor

This project is part of my Master's degree thesis. Originally developed over JDK 6.

### Requirements

* OpenJDK 8 compatible environment to build the project;
* Other projects installed in maven repo:
  * dbpedia-service
  * agrovoc-service
  * sofitex-reader (not sure about this one, but it was also part of the thesis)  

### Notes

Maybe some class won't work as expected; this happens because of some changes made throught the development and time
constraints to keep it fully working. Anyway, it still can be used as a reference to replicate the experiments done in 
the thesis.
